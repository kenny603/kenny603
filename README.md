Hi, I'm Ken Benoit.

I've been coding since I was little, first writing in BASIC on my Commodore VIC-20, and I haven't stopped since.

By day I'm a QA engineer but whenever I have any free time I like to do some side projects (which mostly relate to my gaming habits).
Maybe one of these days I'll finally get around to writing up any of the game ideas I've had rattling around in my head over these years.

My primary language at the moment is Python, but I've also used Perl for many years at previous jobs, not to mention teaching myself Javascript, Lua, bash shell scripting, and others in my off-time.

We'll see if I can keep to making sure my projects live here rather than unmanaged and vulnerable on my hard drive. :P
